# Seeing Learning Build with Badges

One of the challenges of learning (and teaching) is recognizing that understanding and skills build on one another. You "get better" as you move forward and as you reflect and build on your work.

As a way to help you see how understandings and skills forged early in the course and in each unit prepare you for performances later on, I will be awarding you badges based on your work. Many of the intermediate and culminating performances will earn you badges, including recognition for your skill in Reflection, Scaffolding, and Design.

Based on the quality of your work submitted, you will earn badges in each area of recognition according to three levels:

* *Lookout:* You are just starting out on your journey as a learner in this class, and your work reflects beginning quality.
* *Scout:* You are pushing yourself out of your learning comfort zone and taking risks and putting forth effort to learn from the course interactions and materials. Your works reflects intermediate quality.
* *Explorer:* You are pushing yourself as a learner, and you are an explorer worthy of [Humboldt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt). You are not only taking risks and putting forth effort, but it also evident that you are charting, reflecting on, and learning from your course as a learner and future educator. Your work reflects excellent quality.

Each culminating performances requires that you earn *Scout Level or above* in one or more area. If you do not earn a necessary Scout Level badge, you will have one week (based on class policy) to resubmit your work and earn the badge as well as change your grade. After one week, you can still earn an appropriate badge. **I will give you feedback and comments through TaskStream to help you revise and improve your work.** Use this feedback.

**If you do not meet the earned badge requirements, you will not receive credit for the culminating performance until you do.** The standard schedule for submitting assignments applies, that is, *you are required to have earned the required badges by the time you submit your culminating performance.* Earning required badges *after* you submit your culminating performance will affect your score as if the assignment was submitted late.

The following table provides an outline of the required and earned badges for each performance in the course (the Culminating Perofrmance for each unit is **bold**).
