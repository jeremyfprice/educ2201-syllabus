# What are Performances of Understanding?

*Performances of Understanding* are a way for you to demonstrate what you understand while also building your understanding.[^1] These performances can be ongoing short check-ins or projects that can take anywhere from 2 to 5 weeks to complete. The longer **Culminating Performances** will include shorter **Introductory Performances** and **Guided Inquiry Performances** to help you prepare to accomplish the more in-depth work.

**Because each of these Performances build on one another, you will need to "level up" in a satisfactory manner, which will be discussed in a later section.**
