## A Commitment to Universal Learning

*I am committed to the principle of universal learning.* This means that our classroom, our virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning.

Any student with particular needs should contact the coordinator of Disability Services at the start of the semester. Services are available to any student, full or part-time, who has a need because of a [documented] disability.The coordinator of Disability Services can be reached at 304.367.4686 or 800.641.5678 Ext. 8. It is the student's responsibility to register for services with the coordinator of students with disabilities and to provide any necessary documentation to verify a disability or the need for accommodations.  You and I can work out the details of any accommodations for this course.

## Improve Your Chances for Success by Coming to Class Every Day

Being present is important to success in this class. Attendance will be taken at every class, both as a way to help me learn your names and as a way to help you stay on track with attendance. At times, your Warm-Up or Check-Out may be used as a marker of attendance. Contact me, preferably before class, if you have a legitimate reason for not coming to class. See the Course Tools and Practices document for more information.
