# Becoming a Teaching Superhero

<div align="center"><img src="twt-logo.png" /></div>

I want to help you to become teaching superheroes with technology. The children and young adults with whom you will be working deserve nothing less. In order to help you get there, we will be supporting you along the way to develop the practices and routines, digital tools, and knowledge for teaching necessary to be teaching superheroes with technology and getting accepted into the Teacher Education Program in the School of Education, Health and Human Performance at Fairmont State University. We will work hard together to accomplish that goal.

##Course Throughlines

*Throughlines*[^1] are the big ideas that we will be exploring and developing understandings around over the semester.

[^1]Using vocabulary of the profession is important and will help you communicate with your professors and colleagues in a precise and professional manner. We will therefore be using the ideas and language of the Teaching for Understanding (TfU) framework. According to TfU, *throughlines* "describe the most important understandings that students should develop during an entire course."
