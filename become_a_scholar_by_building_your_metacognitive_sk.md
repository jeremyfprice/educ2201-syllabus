# Become a Scholar by Building Your Metacognitive Skills

*Metacognition* means thinking about thinking. Being aware of your own thinking will help you learn more and help you succeed throughout your college career. It is also something that I hope you will help your own students develop when you are a teacher. Metacognition happens in part through (1) setting goals, (2) being intentional about your effort, and (3) reflecting on your learning.

### Reflection Tweets
You will be writing a "Learning Tweet" each week. You won't be using Twitter to write your tweets (you will be writing it directly to me using \texttt{TaskStream}), \marginnote{Your Learning Tweet should be a little longer than the typical tweet on Twitter: no less than three sentences.}but just like Twitter your Learning Tweet will be on the short side. You will be asked to post a Learning Tweet during some weeks directly on the readings, some weeks on class discussions, and some weeks on anything from class that surprised you. \emph{Make sure that your Learning Tweets have something to do with \textbf{this} class}.

The task of each Learning Tweet will be provided in TaskStream. The structure of the general Learning Tweet that focuses on something from the class that surprised you will follow the \texttt{Moment of Surprise}, \texttt{Why It Was Surprising}, and \texttt{What This Tells Me} format:

\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep-0.5em
	\item \texttt{Moment of Surprise:} a short summary of the reading, discussion, or activity you are writing about;
	\item \texttt{Why It Was Surprising:} a short description of what about the reading, discussion, or activity caught your attention, surprised or intrigued you;
	\item \texttt{What This Tells Me:} your "take away" from this surprise, what you learned, how your perspective has changed.
\end{itemize}

The Learning Tweets allow you to make sense of your experiences and gives me a sense of what you are taking away from the class. I often readjust my teaching based on what students tell me through the Surprise Tweets. Keeping track of these "surprises" is a form of ongoing reflection and is an essential component of learning and teaching. We will be reading a short article on surprises in learning during the first week.
