# Improve Your Chances for Success by Coming to Class Every Day

Being present is important to success in this class. Attendance will be taken at every class, both as a way to help me learn your names and as a way to help you stay on track with attendance. At times, your Warm-Up or Check-Out may be used as a marker of attendance.
