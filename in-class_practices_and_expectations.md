# In-Class Practices and Expectations

## A Commitment to Universal Learning

*I am committed to the principle of universal learning.* This means that our classroom, our virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning.

Any student with particular needs should contact the coordinator of Disability Services at the start of the semester. Services are available to any student, full or part-time, who has a need because of a [documented] disability.The coordinator of Disability Services can be reached at 304.367.4686 or 800.641.5678 Ext. 8. It is the student's responsibility to register for services with the coordinator of students with disabilities and to provide any necessary documentation to verify a disability or the need for accommodations.  You and I can work out the details of any accommodations for this course.

## Improve Your Chances for Success by Coming to Class Every Day

Being present is important to success in this class. Attendance will be taken at every class, both as a way to help me learn your names and as a way to help you stay on track with attendance. At times, your Warm-Up or Check-Out may be used as a marker of attendance. See the Course Tools and Practices document for more information.

## Participate Effectively to Get More Out of Class Time

We learn best when we converse with others about ideas and concepts, and participation is an important practice for success in university academic life in general. Ongoing participation is an important and required practice in this course. See the Course Tools and Practices document for more information.

## Take Knowledge from Class to Projects by Taking Notes

I will be asking you to cite specific information from class and from the readings in your Reflection Write-Ups for your Performances of Understandings. Taking notes will help you to refer back to our discussions and use them in your Reflection Write-Ups. An important part of becoming a successful learner is moving ideas from one context to another, and I hope that this process will help you build some of the same practices with your own students in the future. See the Course Tools and Practices document for more information.

## Stay Current by Keeping In Touch Outside of Class

Communications between me and you outside of class will occur over email. **Do not send me messages through Blackboard**. All feedback through TaskStream will also be delivered through your Fairmont State email account.

Please make sure to *check your Fairmont State email on a regular basis* (at least 4-5 times per week). If you do not have a smart phone, a computer or internet access at home or in your dorm room, make it a regular practice to go to the library and check your email there.
