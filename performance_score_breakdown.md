# Performance Score Breakdown

Keep in mind that **you earn your grade**. I do not "give" you a grade. As a teacher, I place a great deal of emphasis on becoming aware of learning processes and progress, rather than "getting" a grade. *This is a practice that is important to bring to your own students,* so I want to give you a head start.
