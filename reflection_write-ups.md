# Reflection Write-Ups

Reflecting on your work and your practice is an important part of being a teacher. I will help you develop these skills through structured reflections on your experiences throughout the semester. Each reflection will follow a slightly different structure, so make sure that you look closely at what is required of the reflection. The basic parts of a reflection involve *framing* and *reframing.* Framing refers to describing in detail the way that your project was completed. Reframing refers to describing in detail how you--or a make-believe educator--might use your project in the future. This method of reflection will allow you to look back on what you've done as well as project into the future as to how you might use what you have learned in your own teaching practices.

Each Reflection is worth 10% of Culminating Performance points. The Reflection Write-Up is a required part of the project process and your submission will be returned to you if you do not also submit a Reflection Write-Up.
