# Keeping the Learning Going by Reviewing Your Feedback

Making adjustments to your work is part of the learning process. There is also a possibility that you did not fulfill the requirements of the task or you did not "level up"; in this case, I will ask you to revise and resubmit your work through TaskStream. **If you don't check TaskStream and look at your feedback, you won't know this.**

You always have the option of resubmitting your work if you feel that you have learned from my feedback and want to show me what you have learned. For any reason, you have *one week* from the time I provide you with feedback to resubmit your work for review.
