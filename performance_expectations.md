# Performance Expectations

This course does not have any "real" tests, with the exception of the occasional quick check for understanding. Instead, much of the work is in terms of projects, or Culminating Performances of Understanding. 

## Maintain an Even Pace by Submitting Your Work

It is  necessary to be very mindful of your use of time in this course. This class is a marathon, not a sprint: you *cannot* succeed by cramming for exams in this course, as you may be able to do with courses that rely on tests.

To maintain your momentum, it is important to keep up with the work and submit your work on time. All work is due in TaskStream on the date posted by Pumpkin Hour (11:59pm).

If you are unable to complete your work by the posted due date, you may fill out a Late Performance Contract (http://bit.ly/2201-lpc) *before Pumpkin Hour of the posted due date*. Late Performance Contracts filled out after Pumpkin Hour will not be accepted.

You are required to fill out this contract in its entirety. As part of filling this contract, you have two options: (1) scheduling a meeting with me to discuss any challenges you are having in completing the performance and getting the help that you need from me; or, (2) scheduling a new **firm** date by which you will complete the performance. *This new date CANNOT be rescheduled.* You will not receive any points for a performance submitted after this rescheduled date, but you will receive your earned badge. *Choose this rescheduled date very carefully.*

If you do not fill out a Late Performance Contract, work may be turned in up to seven days late **with consequences:**

| Time Late        | Consequence                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 Day            | 5% deduction off performance score  |
| 2-3 Days         | 10% deduction off performance score |
| 4-5 Days         | 15% deduction off performance score |
| 6-7 Days         | 20% deduction off performance score |
| More Than 7 Days | You will receive no points for your performance score, but you will receive your earned badge. |

Reflection Performances, because they are completed in class and are also a way for me to take attendance, **cannot** be turned in late.

## Keeping the Learning Going by Reviewing Your Feedback

Making adjustments to your work is part of the learning process. There is also a possibility that you did not fulfill the requirements of the task or you did not "level up"; in this case, I will ask you to revise and resubmit your work through TaskStream. **If you don't check TaskStream and look at your feedback, you won't know this.**

You always have the option of resubmitting your work if you feel that you have learned from my feedback and want to show me what you have learned. For any reason, you have *one week* from the time I provide you with feedback to resubmit your work for review.
